This is my final project submitted for my first Objective-C class. This game
is highly modified from the code game example given in the book Build iOS
Games with Sprite Kit - Unleash Your Imagination in Two Dimensions. The base
game was just dropping enemies and had a starfield. I implemented health,
ship speed and photon speed powerups, added a start and end screen, and made
many modifications to objects and properties.
